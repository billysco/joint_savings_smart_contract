# joint_savings_smart_contract
## Overview
Creating a joint savings account smart contract using solidity. The contract begins by defining 5 variables (accountOne, accountTwo, lastToWithdraw, lastWithdrawlAmount, and contractBalance). Then, functions are created to set the accounts, deposit, withdraw, and a default fallback function to store ether sent from outside the deposit function. 
## Usage
Screenshots demonstrating the usage of this contract are attached below.
